We have 3 friend status:

. CONFIRMED
. UNCONFIRMED_FRIEND_REQUEST     - we didn't confirmed this friend
. WAITING_FRIEND_CONFIRMATION    - we will wait while the friend confirms our request

CONFIRMED and WAITING_CONFIRMATION friends goes from table "friends". (select * from friends where user = :current_user)

. If confirm = 0 then    status = WAITING_FRIEND_CONFIRMATION
. If confirm = 1 then    status = CONFIRMED

UNCONFIRMED_FRIEND_REQUEST status goes from table "friends". (select * from friends where friend = :current_user and confirm = 0)

== Log module

Each OWNER has a log which stores information about current updates (states, friends request e.t.c.).

TIP: LogEntity saveLog(String username, String message)


== Score module

FRIENDSHIP_SCORE + PERSONAL_SCORE = TOTAL_SCORE

FRIENDSHIP_SCORES increments in the case you help your friend to change a state of your pet

PERSONAL_SCORE increments when you change a state of your pet

== Pet states module

The pet can have four states:

. BORED
. DIRTY
. HUNGRY
. SICK

Each state can be changed by user or by a friend.
Program randomly chooses which state can be changed by the user or by a friend.
