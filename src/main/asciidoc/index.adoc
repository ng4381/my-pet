We have 3 friend status:

. CONFIRMED
. UNCONFIRMED_FRIEND_REQUEST     - we didn't confirmed this friend
. WAITING_FRIEND_CONFIRMATION    - we will wait while the friend confirms our request

[NOTE]
====
CONFIRMED and WAITING_CONFIRMATION friends goes from table "friends". (select * from friends where user = :current_user)

. If confirm = 0 then    status = WAITING_FRIEND_CONFIRMATION
. If confirm = 1 then    status = CONFIRMED

UNCONFIRMED_FRIEND_REQUEST status goes from table "friends". (select * from friends where friend = :current_user and confirm = 0)

== Log module

Each OWNER has a log which stores information about current updates (states, friends request e.t.c.).

TIP: LogEntity saveLog(String username, String message)


== Score module

FRIENDSHIP_SCORE + PERSONAL_SCORE = TOTAL_SCORE

FRIENDSHIP_SCORES increments in the case you help your friend to change a state of your pet

PERSONAL_SCORE increments when you change a state of your pet

== Pet states module

=== General logic
The pet can have four states:

. BORED
. DIRTY
. HUNGRY
. SICK

Each state can be changed by user or by a friend.
Program randomly chooses which state can be changed by the user or by a friend.

=== Classes/Table description

There are several classes responsible for a logic of changing the states. They stored in the package com/nservices/mypet/operations.
This classes runs by the framework "Quartz".

Information about states stores in the table "petstateinfo" (PetStateInfoEntity.class)

|===
|id|pet_id|state|last_modification|start|minutes|active|only_friend
|2|1|SICK|2022-12-23 22:2228|2022-12-10 12:25:43|19316|1|0
|2|2|BORED|2022-12-23 22:2228|2022-12-10 12:22:43|19319|1|0
|===

=== Activating/Resetting the state

Activating the states happens automatically by "Quartz" framework.
Framework triggers execution() method of each operation (state)


==== Activating

Each state (operation) has its own static variable. For instance, state Bored (BoredModifyOperation.class) has a variable BORED_TIME_MINUTES.
This variable shows how much time should pass after last modification (active=0) before switching the state on.

If (active == 0 AND start - current_time >= BORED_TIME_MINUTES) then

. make it active
. set ACTIVE == 1
. set STAR_TIME and LAST_MODIFICATION_TIME == current_time
. set MINUTES == 0
. set FRIEND_ONLY == 0 or 1 (randomly)

NOTE: We always update existing record. When we create a new pet we create record for each state.


==== Prolonging the state

If state is activated program prolongs it state by

. changing LAST_MODIFICATION_TIME == current_time
. changing MINUTES == (START_TIME - current_time)

==== Resetting the state

NOTE: Resetting the state happens in the class PetService.class

When user sends a POST request program resets the record for this state.

. sets ACTIVE == 0
. sets STAR_TIME and LAST_MODIFICATION_TIME == current_time
. sets MINUTES == 0
. sets FRIEND_ONLY == 0

There are two ways to reset the state

. user resetting his own state
. user resetting his friends state
